## WHAT IS IT?
This model simulates the growth of microbial cells in a 2-dimensional environment where they are periodically stressed by a toxin. You could imagine this universe as a culture of bacteria growing on agar in a (very small) petri dish that experimenters flood occasionally with antibiotics, or perhaps microbes growing on your skin, which you periodically wash with soap. Cells can degrade the toxin, but degradation takes energy, so there is a tradeoff: toxin-degrading cells reproduce more slowly. Moreover, because the toxin can diffuse through space, cells that degrade toxin are helping their neighbors.

One of the key features of this model is that although the cells are all of the same population (that is, they're genetically identical*), it's possible for the individuals to have different phenotypes-- specifically, to have different abilities to degrade the toxin. This phenomenon is sometimes called "phenotypic heterogeneity," and we're interested in it because microbiologists have discovered that organisms can use phenotypic heterogeneity as a strategy for survival in stressful and unpredictable environments. It's an example of how microbes can generate more complex adaptive responses than we usually think. (Please see the References section for more information.)

The purpose of the Pheno-Evo model is to explore what the best strategy might be for the population as a whole to survive under different environmental conditions. In what cases does the population stand the best chances of surviving if all cells spend most of their energy on degrading toxin? When is it better to have some few toxin-degraders and some cells specialized at growing fast? As the experimenter, you can test different strategies and different conditions; you can also allow your population to evolve and see what solution it comes up with!

*Except in the case of mutation. If you run this model with mutation, it's important to consider both genetic diversity and phenotypic diversity at the same time.


## HOW IT WORKS
We start with **n** microbial cells randomly distributed across the environment, one cell per patch. At each timestep, the following happens:

1. Toxin is added to the environment and diffuses according to the parameters **pulse-rate,** **toxin-conc,** **pulsing-random?** and **diff-rate**. Patches are color-coded by toxin concentration, a gradient from white = 0 to black = 1.

2. Cells get the chance to change their phenotype, according to the regime set by the user.
This may entail drawing from a distribution of potential phenotype values, as determined by **phenotype-dist,** and **phenotype-parm.** Or, if **phenotype-parm** = "responsive," cells sense and respond to the environmental conditions according to **env-noise** and **initial-response-error** (see below for details.) Sensing and responding accurately takes energy and therefore decreases a cell's reproduction rate.

3. Cells degrade the toxin in their patch according to their phenotypic ability (**degrade-rate**). Degrading toxin also takes energy and therefore decreases reproduction rate.

4. The remaining toxin injures the cells, decreasing their overall **health**. Cells with low health have a lower reproductive rate (**growth-rate**), and when health falls below a certain threshold, they die.

5. Cells get the chance to reproduce onto a nearby patch; as mentioned above, reproduction capacity depends on health, and on how much energy is spent on degrading toxin and sensing the environment. Reproduction occurs only if a nearby patch is empty. Daughter cells inherit all the genotypic properties of their parents, but may mutate some of those values according to **mutation-rate.** Phenotype is not heritable.

6. If the environment gets filled up with cells, the population is diluted: a random set of cells are removed and the survivors are redistributed across the environment. The fraction of survivors may be chosen by the **dilute-rate** parameter.


Each cell has:

  1. A phenotype: rules for behavior that are not heritable, and can be changed. This consists solely of:
    * **degrade-rate** = the rate at which the cell degrades toxin in its patch. At each timestep, the value of degrade-rate is subtracted from the concentration of the toxin
  2. A genotype: rules for behavior that are heritable, and are fixed except in the case of mutation. This consists of:
    * **switch-rate** = the probability of switching phenotype at each timestep
    * **response-error** = if we're in a regime where cells sense the environment (**phenotype-dist** = "responsive), response-error describes how lax the cell is in its response. 
    * **barcode** = this is just an identity marker indicating who the cell's founding ancestor was, in case it's of interest. It has no impact on behavior.
    * **generation** = a number indicating how far descended this cell is from the original ancestor; when a cell reproduces, the daughter inherits the parent's generation and adds 1. Generation has no impact on behavior.
  3. A physiology: characteristics of the cell that change with conditions
    * **health** = how well the cell is doing, generally. Toxin exposure reduces health
    * **growth-rate** = the probability the cell will reproduce at each timestep. This is recalculated each timestep based on the cell's health and the energy it is spending on sensing its environment and degrading toxin.


## HOW TO USE IT
Choose your settings using the sliders, switches, chooser, and input fields to the left of the environment. Then hit **setup.** (Some parameters will update dynamically if you change them while the model is running, but it's safest to re-do setup after any changes.) Then hit **go.** 

What the parameter settings do:

* **n**: the number of cells in the initial population
* **pulse-rate**: number of ticks that elapse between each time the toxin is added to the environment. Set at 1 for constant toxin influx.
* **toxin-conc**: the concentration of toxin added to each patch, when toxin is added to the environment. This does not need to be bounded, but we typically work between 0 and 1.0.
* **initial-switch-rate**: the probability that each cell in the population will switch phenotype at each timestep. If there is no evolution (**mutation-rate** = 0), all cells retain the **initial-switch-rate** as their **switch-rate**, and it remains constant for all cells all the time. If there is evolution (**mutation-rate** > 0), **initial-switch-rate** is the value that all cells start with, but their **switch-rate** values may evolve away from it over time.
* **initial-response-error**: if **phenotype-dist** = "responsive," then when cells switch phenotype, they try to choose a phenotype value that matches the concentration of toxin they sense on their patch (**signal** of the patch). But they're not perfect: they actually draw from a normal distribution, where **signal** is the mean and **response-error** is the standard deviation. So the bigger **response-error** is, the worse the organisms are at responding to their environment. 
Also, the bigger **response-error** is, the less energy the cells spend on sensing their environment (leaving more energy for reproduction).
If there is no evolution (**mutation-rate** = 0), then **response-error** for all cells is the same all the time, and it's equal to **initial-response-error**. If there is evolution (**mutation-rate** > 0), then the population begins with **response-error** = **initial-response-error**, but may evolve away from it.
* **env-noise**: In this universe, it is possible that it might be difficult for any organism to detect how much toxin there is, regardless of how much energy the cells put into reducing their * **response-error**. We model such an environment by allowing each patch a **signal** that it sends out to organisms. The **signal** is drawn from a normal distribution for which the mean is **toxin** (the actual concentration of toxin in the patch) and the standard deviation is **env-noise.** The larger **env-noise** is, the harder it is for organisms to understand what's going on in their environment.
* **diff-rate**: The rate at which toxin diffuses from one patch to its neighboring patches. **diff-rate** = 0 means no diffusion at all. **diff-rate** = x means that x*100% of the toxin in the patch is distributed equally among its 8 neighboring patches. Note that the lower **diff-rate** is, the less the toxin-degrading activity of a cell is able to affect the concentration of toxin in neighboring patches.
* **color-code**: The cells in the model are color-coded to indicate something about them, and you can choose what color code you'd like using this drop-down menu. 
  * "growth-rate": this is a gradient from pink = low to green = high
  * "degrade-rate": this is a gradient from red = low to blue = high
  * "barcode": each cell in the founding population starts with a distinct **barcode** and its progeny all share the same barcode-- so you can easily see which lineages beat out other lineages. each barcode receives a distinct randomly-chosen color. 
* **mutation-rate**: the probability that a cell will mutate in any given timestep. If the cell mutates, it mutates both switch-rate and response-error at the same time. **mutation-rate** = 0 means no evolution.
* **dilute-rate**: the divisor by which the population is reduced, when dilution step takes place. * **dilute-rate** = 0 means no dilution; cells are only removed from the environment when they die due to toxin exposure. **dilute-rate** = 5 means 1/5 of the population is retained. **dilute-rate** = 100 means 1/100 of the population is retained.
* **pulsing-random? ** "Off" = toxin pulses come at regular intervals determined by pulse-rate. "On" = toxin pulses come at random intervals, where intervals are chosen from a uniform distribution with mean of **pulse-rate**.
* **phenotype-parm**: parameter contributing to phenotype distribution. Its precise meaning depends on phenotype-dist.
* **phenotype-dist**: the shape of the distribution from which **degrade-rate** is drawn when organisms switch phenotype. This is true for the entire population. Options are as follows:
  * "binary": a binary distribution where cells can have only values of 0 or 1. The fraction of cells with 0 is equal to **phenotype-parm**.
  * "normal": a normal distribution with mean **phentotype-parm** and standard deviation 0.1
  * "uniform": a uniform distribution between 0 and 1
  * "exponential": an exponential distribution with mean **phenotype-parm**
  * "one-value": all cells have a single degrade-rate, equal to **phenotype-parm**
  * "responsive": cells sense the toxin concentration in their patch and switch their **degrade-rate** to match that value, with the caveats that they are actually sensing **signal**, which might not be equal to the real **toxin** value, and how accurately they are able to match their **degrade-rate** to the **signal** depends on their **response-error**.


## THINGS TO NOTICE
* Under **color-code,** select **degrade-rate** to color your microbial cells by their phenotypic toxin degrading capacity. Observe the patches of colored cells and see which colors expand fastest and which slowest, and which ones survive when there is a pulse of toxin. Notice what's going on in the spots where the toxin disappears most quickly.

* Under **color-code,** select **barcode** to color your microbial cells by their family lineage. Watch as each founding cell gives rise to a colony of descendants, and observe whether any founders win over any other founders. Observe the difference it makes when there is bottlenecking (**dilute-rate** > 0) and when there is not (**dilute-rate** = 0). Are there cases in which just a single founder wins out? Does it make a difference whether there is evolution (**mutation-rate** >0) or not?

* The dilution step is programmed so that the population gets diluted only if the number of turtles is equal to or greater than the number of patches. This means that, even when dilute-rate > 0, there are some situations in which dilution does not happen. As you run the model, notice whether you encounter any such situations. What causes it?  

## THINGS TO TRY
This is a complicated model, with a lot of bells and whistles! It's fun to change them all at once, but perhaps not very informative. We recommend doing controlled experiments by turning several of the options to 0 and changing just one or two things at a time. Here are some examples:

### No evolution: which phenotype distribution is the best?
* Set the following to 0: mutation-rate, initial-response-error, env-noise. Set pulsing-random to Off.
* Pick your favorite values for the following parameters and hold them constant: pulse-rate, toxin-conc, initial-switch-rate, dilute-rate.
* Run the model several times, choosing a different option for phenotype-dist each time. You may also change phenotype-parm each time. Which distributions are able to survive indefinitely? Which ones have the highest growth rates, or reach the highest number of generations in the shortest amount of time? Which ones fizzle and die?
* Now, pick one of the variables you previously kept constant (pulse-rate, toxin-conc, initial-switch-rate, dilute-rate) and change it, and see how that changes your results. For instance, does the concentration of toxin in the environment affect whether a one-value distribution is more successful than a uniform distribution?
* Advanced: Just because you set the distribution of phenotypes that the population can draw from, that doesn't mean the population will actually fall into that distribution at steady state once environmental selection has taken its toll. This is most apparent when cells aren't able to switch from one phenotype to another very fast. To observe this, set initial-switch-rate to 0, dilute-rate to 100, and phenotype-dist to "uniform." Try running with toxin-conc = 1. Check out the _Phenotype: degrade rate_ histogram. Does that actually look like a uniform distribution? Repeat with toxin-conc = 0.
Now imagine these organisms lived out in the wild, and you were a microbial ecologist studying them through observation. From your observations of their behaviors, what would you infer about these organisms' underlying genetic capacity for degrading toxin, and for reproducing? Would you be right? 

### With evolution: how do organisms deal when the environment is unpredictable?
* Set the following parameters to your favorite value (not 0) and keep constant: pulse-rate, toxin-conc, diff-rate, mutation-rate, dilute-rate.
* Set pulsing-random? "Off" and phenotype-dist "responsive"
* Set initial-switch-rate and initial-response-error to 0.5
* Run the model several times, and vary env-noise between 0 and 1. Switch-rate and response-error will evolve over time; watch what happens to them in the plot windows, and/or export data in a spreadsheet and analyze in R.
* When env-noise = 0, organisms are able to sense their environment-- that is, they can tell how much toxin is in their patch. But when env-noise = 1, the signal that organisms get from their environment is random and has no connection to the actual value of the toxin in their patch.
We hypothesize that it is a good strategy for organisms to switch their phenotype to match the toxin in their patch: if the toxin is high, they stand the best chances of surviving if they switch to a high degrade-rate so that they can degrade the toxin quickly, before it kills them. If the toxin is low, they should switch to a low degrade-rate because the pressure to degrade toxin is not as strong, and they can use the extra energy to reproduce more quickly. Therefore, in a world where it is possible for organisms to sense their environment perfectly (env-noise = 0), they will probably evolve toward being able to make that switch with accuracy (response-error = 0), even if it means spending more energy on being accurate. However, in a world where organisms are unable to tell what the toxin concentration is no matter how hard they try (env-noise = 1), it is not worth spending energy on accurate sensing mechanisms, so they will evolve toward making their switch randomly (response-error = 1).
You can test whether this hypothesis is correct!


### Other things to try
* Does it matter whether toxin pulses are periodic or aperiodic? Toggle **pulsing-random?** on and off. Keep in mind that you may also need to change **pulse-rate** for a fair comparison between the two.

* What happens when organisms can't influence each others' environment at all? Turn **diffusion-rate** down to zero to find out.

* How big a difference does dilution make? This is especially interesting when you have evolution turned on (mutation-rate > 0). Without dilution, population turnover is slow, because there are no new births until cells clear space by dying from toxin exposure. With dilution, turnover is constant, so there are many more generations-- but the individuals that survive the bottleneck from one dilution to the next are chosen at random, so there is a distinct possibility for drift. Try carrying out the same experiment without dilution (dilute-rate = 0) or with it (say, dilute-rate = 100), or change the bottleneck size by playing with the value of dilute-rate. Observe the maximum number of generations over time in the built-in plot window, or export your data and use our R script to analyze the average number of generations over time in each experiment.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL
The dynamics in this model are based roughly on biological principles, but there are many reasonable alternative ways of executing things, and changing those details could change the way the model behaves. Here are just three examples:

* We tried to scale most variables between 0 and 1, but it might make more sense for them not all to be on the same scale. For instance, you could allow toxin-conc to go up to 10 even if degrade-rate still only goes up to 1.
* We've chosen to make the fitness trade-offs equal and additive: the energy spent on environment sensing and toxin degradation can each take up to 50% of an organism's energy. You may choose to change the way that works.
* We don't explicitly model the consumption of a growth substrate-- we assume that it's unlimited. But you could add a growth substrate and have individuals compete for that resource, perhaps introducing a fitness tradeoff between substrate utilization and the ability to degrade toxin.

In an effort to avoid going completely over the top in complexity, we've kept the options for evolution in this model somewhat limited. We initiate the population with individuals that are all identical. And if you allow evolution (mutation-rate > 0), organisms can only evolve their switch rate and response error, and both must evolve at the same time. If you're very interested in the evolutionary dynamics, you are welcome to change that. Some things to try might include:

* Initiate with a mixed population (not all genotypes identical) and look at the results of competition
* Allow switch rate and response error to evolve at different rates
* Allow phenotype-parm to evolve

Finally, it's likely you'll want to monitor some variables that are different from what is shown in our built-in plot windows. You can add any plot windows you like; to learn how, check out the NetLogo manual.
